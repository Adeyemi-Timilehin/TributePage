                <h2>Early Life and Career</h2>
                <p>Alan Mathison Turing OBE FRS (/ˈtjʊərɪŋ/; 23 June 1912 – 7 June 1954) was an English[6] mathematician,
                    computer scientist, logician, cryptanalyst, philosopher and theoretical biologist.Turing was highly
                    influential in the development of theoretical computer science, providing a formalisation of the
                    concepts of algorithm and computation with the Turing machine, which can be considered a model of a
                    general-purpose computer. Turing is widely considered to be the father of theoretical computer science
                    and artificial intelligence.</p>

                        <h3>Early life</h3>
                        <p>Alan Turning was born <time datetime="23/06/1912">June 23<sup>rd</sup>1912</time>in Britain. The
                            son of a civil servant, Turing was educated at a top private school.After graduating in 1934, he
                            was elected to a fellowship at King’s College (his college since 1931) in recognition of his
                            research in probability theory. <h3>Engagement</h3>
                            <p>In 1941, Turing proposed marriage to Hut 8 colleague<a
                                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joan_Clarke"> Joan Clarke</a>, a fellow
                                mathematician and cryptanalyst, but their engagement was short-lived. After admitting his
                                homosexuality to his fiancée, who was reportedly "unfazed" by the revelation, Turing decided
                                that he could not go through with the marriage</p>
                            <p>In 1936 Turing's seminal paper <q>On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the
                                    Entscheidungsproblem [ Decision Problem]</q> was recommended for publication by the
                                American mathematical logician Alonzo Church, who had himself just published a paper that
                                reached the same conclusion as Turing’s, although by a different method. <p> Turing’s method
                                    (but not so much Church’s) had profound significance for the emerging science of
                                    computing. Later that year Turing moved to Princeton University to study for a Ph.D. in
                                    mathematical logic under Church’s direction (completed in 1938).Turing was highly
                                    influential in the development of theoretical computer science, providing a
                                    formalisation of the concepts of algorithm and computation with the Turing machine,
                                    which can be considered a model of a general-purpose computer<cite> Newman, M.H.A.

                        <h3>Code Breaker</h3>
                        <p>Having returned from the United States to his fellowship at King’s College in the summer of 1938,
                            Turing went on to join the Government Code and Cypher School, and, at the outbreak of war with
                            Germany in September 1939, he moved to the organization’s wartime headquarters at Bletchley
                            Park, Buckinghamshire. A few weeks previously, the Polish government had given Britain and
                            France details of the Polish successes against Enigma, the principal cipher machine used by the
                            German military to encrypt radio communications. As early as 1932, a small team of Polish
                            mathematician-cryptanalysts, led by Marian Rejewski, had succeeded in deducing the internal
                            wiring of Enigma, and by 1938 Rejewski’s team had devised a code-breaking machine they called
                            the Bomba (the Polish word for a type of ice cream). The Bomba depended for its success on
                            German operating procedures, and a change in those procedures in May 1940 rendered the Bomba
                            useless. During the autumn of 1939 and the spring of 1940, Turing and others designed a related,
                            but very different, code-breaking machine known as the Bombe. For the rest of the war, Bombes
                            supplied the Allies with large quantities of military intelligence. By early 1942 the
                            cryptanalysts at Bletchley Park were decoding about 39,000 intercepted messages each month, a
                            figure that rose subsequently to more than 84,000 per month—two messages every minute, day and
                            night. In 1942 Turing also devised the first systematic method for breaking messages encrypted
                            by the sophisticated German cipher machine that the British called “Tunny.” At the end of the
                            war, Turing was made an Officer of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (OBE) for his
                            code-breaking work.</p>

                        <h3>Computer Designer</h3>
                        <p>In 1945, the war over, Turing was recruited to the National Physical Laboratory (NPL) in London
                            to create an electronic computer. His design for the Automatic Computing Engine (ACE) was the
                            first complete specification of an electronic stored-program all-purpose digital computer. Had
                            Turing’s ACE been built as he planned, it would have had vastly more memory than any of the
                            other early computers, as well as being faster. However, his colleagues at NPL thought the
                            engineering too difficult to attempt, and a much smaller machine was built, the Pilot Model ACE
                            (1950).

                    <p>Turing was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of London in March 1951, a high honour, yet his life
                        was about to become very hard. In March 1952 he was convicted of “gross indecency”—that is to say,
                        homosexuality, a crime in Britain at that time—and he was sentenced to 12 months of hormone
                        “therapy.” Now with a criminal record, he would never again be able to work for Government
                        Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), the British government’s postwar code-breaking centre.</p>

                            <h3>Death</h3>
                            <p>On<time datetime="8/06/1954"> 8 June 1954<time>, Turing's housekeeper found him dead at the
                                        age of 41; he had died the previous day. Cyanide poisoning was established as the
                                        cause of death.[138] When his body was discovered, an apple lay half-eaten beside
                                        his bed, and although the apple was not tested for cyanide,[139] it was speculated
                                        that this was the means by which Turing had consumed a fatal dose. An inquest
                                        determined that he had committed suicide. Andrew Hodges and another biographer,
                                        David Leavitt, have both speculated that Turing was re-enacting a scene from the
                                        Walt Disney film Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937), his favourite fairy tale.
                                        Both men noted that (in Leavitt's words) he took "an especially keen pleasure in the
                                        scene where the Wicked Queen immerses her apple in the poisonous brew".Turing's
                                        remains were cremated at Woking Crematorium on<time datetime="12/06/1954"> 12 June
